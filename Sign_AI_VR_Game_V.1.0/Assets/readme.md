This file aims to guide what each component of the game represents.

Important things:
->Hierarchy window (https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Hierarchy.html)
    Everything that will be added into UnityScene can be view on "Hierachy window"
    It also allows you to organize in parent-child, think parent as Class and child as object in OOP. For example: if you delete the parent, everything that is attached to parent object will be deleted.

MAIN SCENE: "VR"
- Game 
- UI
